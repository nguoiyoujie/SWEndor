Explosion Generator v 1.1
=========================
Copyright Cliff Harris 2002


Changes
v1.1 : Added support for colouring the background

Feel free to use this little program to make explosion texture 'pages' for 2D or 3D games.
No royalties required, but if you use them in your game I'd love a free copy!
