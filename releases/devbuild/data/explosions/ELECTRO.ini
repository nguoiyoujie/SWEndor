# ELECTRO
# TO-DO: Has persistence logic yet to be transferred
# Fighters may keep electro until they are destroyed
# Ship systems may show electro while EMPed
# But this electro anim will always last for 10s!
# Suggestion: To describe the behavior at Actor (WHILE_DYING / ATTACH_TO_ACTOR|WHILE_STUNNED), which can be used to override TimedLife, or stop it from decreasing
