[DYNAMIC]
# If dynamic is used, a new shader is needed to maintain the large amount of laser elements.
# Creating new shader instances is expensive and introduces significant lag.
# Lasers travel over 2000 units per second, having several seconds of lifetime. Typically, they decay outside the battlefield
# The player will not likely notice lasers disappearing due to time decay. 
# So, forget about using DYING_TIME_REMAINING
