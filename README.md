# SWEndor
This is a remake of the free Star Wars games originally made by **Bruno. R. Marcos** back in the early 2000s. The [Battle of Endor](http://www.moddb.com/games/starwars-battle-of-endor) was the first of such game to be published by him, and the project name is thus named in this honor.

Mr. Marcos had also released the [Battle of Yavin](http://www.moddb.com/games/starwars-battle-of-yavin) a few years after. While Mr Marcos had released a preview of the [Escape from Hoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ug51qrJwc), the game was unfortunately not yet published at the making of this project (January 2018). Eventually, I hope this project can bring even that into fruition.


## About this Project

This non-commercial project aims to recreate the enjoyable (and rage-inducing, mostly rage-inducing) elements of the original projects by . The open-source nature of this project allows for expansion and improvement, which will hopefully bring about other elements that an fellow enthusiast can think up of. 

While this project begins as a recreation of Mr. Marco's SW games, this project's core is a 3D flight/combat simulator, and is thus not limited in content. You may use this to recreate a WWII scenario, for instance, should the right models and logical sequence are available.


## Prerequisites

This project is created and maintained with Visual Studio 2015.

The game requires Microsoft .NET Framework v1.1 and v2.0. Note that higher .NET versions up to v3.5 can also support v2.0.

The game uses [TrueVision3D 6.5](http://www.truevision3d.com/) to perform 3D rendering and calculations. 
TV3D requires at least DirectX 8.1 and a 32-bit 3D graphics card to run properly.
TV3D can only be run on 32-bit Windows.

While the resource specifications may change with the project, it is recommended to have at least 2 GHz and at least 2 CPU cores for a minimum performance. If you have difficulty running the Main Menu at 55 - 60 FPS, your machine may be not have sufficient capacity to play the game.
